# A simple Swift + Metal 3D engine example.

This demo uses Toy3D https://github.com/markdaws/Toy3D - a simple 3D engine written in Swift + Metal.

The purpose of the engine is to let someone new to the Metal framework work through a real example from beginning to end, touching all the main Metal types.

Along with this code, there is a blog post that details the whole process here, I recommend reading that first: http://markdaws.net/blog/2019-12-17-toy3d

To swap between the demos, run the app then touch the screen to cycle through the color cube, texture cube, multiple cubes (100 then 10,000) and a demo of loading the Standford Bunny dataset (data from: https://casual-effects.com/data/)

For the 10,000 cubes you will want to run it in release mode, debug works but is a little bit choppy.
